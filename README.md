# Predict Click through rate (CTR) for a website
> The problem of interest is the prediction of the apply rate. Imagine a user visiting a website, and performing a job search. From the set of displayed results, user clicks on certain ones that she is interested in, and after checking job descriptions, she further clicks on apply button therein to land in to an application page. The apply rate is defined as the fraction of applies (after visiting job description pages), and the goal is to predict this metric using the dataset described in the following section.


## General Information
### Situation : 
-  The problem of interest is the prediction of the apply rate. Imagine a user visiting a website, and performing a job search.
- the apply rate is defined as the fraction of applies (after visiting job description pages), and the goal is to predict this metric using the dataset described in the following section.

### Task : 
- We have to identify wants to know which variables are significant in predicting the user apply or not, and How well those variables describe that user apply or not.

### Action : 
- Create a Logistic Regression With PCA feature selection and decision tree for solve classification problem.

### Result
- Accuracy Score of Decision Tree is 91%
- 6 columns are best fit to model According to PCA
